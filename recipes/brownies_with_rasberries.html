    <p>My daughter wanted brownies with raspberries for her class as a treat for her birthday and since I did not want to make huge brownies for all the kids I came up with these mini desserts.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup white suggar</li>
        <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Ganache</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>28 raspberries</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup mini muffin pan and an 8-inch square pan with 1 teaspoon butter and 1 teaspoon flour each.</li><br>
        <li>Melt 1 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat; stir in sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth. Fold in 1 cup flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt gently.</li><br>
        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups using a small ice cream scoop, filling each 3/4 full. Pour remaining batter into the square pan.</li><br>
        <li>Bake both pans in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few crumbs attached, about 12 minutes for the mini muffins and 20 minutes for the square pan. Remove from oven and cool in the pan for 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer round brownies to a wire rack to cool. Let 8-inch pan of brownies cool in the pan, about 2 hours. Cut into 16 small squares.</li><br>
        <li>Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it almost boils, about 3 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Place chopped chocolate into a bowl. Pour hot cream over chocolate and whisk until smooth. Cool until thickened, about 2 hours.</li><br>
        <li>Place a dollop of ganache onto each brownie piece. Top each with 1 raspberry.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
    <p>Since I only have 1 mini muffin pan, I baked the brownie batter in both a mini muffin tin and an 8-inch square pan which resulted in 12 round mini brownies and 16 square mini brownies, which was perfect.</p>
    <p>If you forget the ganache in the fridge (it has happened to me!) and it gets too hard, just put a couple of tablespoons at a time in a small bowl and heat in the microwave for a few seconds until softened and then put little dollops on your brownies to "glue" the raspberries.</p>
